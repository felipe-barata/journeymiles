#### Motivation
<p>
I decided to practice with this project to remember some basic concepts of development with Kotlin and Spring, since we rarely create any project from scratch in work environments. We always take something already in progress or follow some company model/standard.  
So the idea is to take something from scratch and try to apply the best development practices and, of course, always improve my development skills.

#### About the project
<p>
The goal of this project is to simulate an application to recommend travel destinations, I think the goal of the challenge was to keep it simple, but I intend on using some advanced features like storing every image on S3 buckets.
</p>
<p>
This project will be divided into three stages (the idea is to do one a week, but I can't promise anything lol):

1. Create the testimonials CRUD APIs and the endpoint to display three random testimonials
2. Create the destinies CRUD APIs and the endpoint to search for a destination using it`s name
3. Update the destinies entity, create an endpoint to search for a destination by ID and use some AI to describe the destination
</p>

#### Tech stack
<p>
 - Kotlin development language
 - SpringBoot framework
 - Postgresql for the database
 - S3 for storing images (Emulated through Localstack)
 - Docker & soon Kubernetes
